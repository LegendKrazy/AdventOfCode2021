# Advent of Code 2021 Day 2 Challenge
# forward X increases the horizontal position by X units.
# down X increases the depth by X units.
# up X decreases the depth by X units.
# Your horizontal position and depth both start at 0
# Calculate the horizontal position and depth you would have after following the planned course.
# What do you get if you multiply your final horizontal position by your final depth?

depth = 0
x_position = 0
